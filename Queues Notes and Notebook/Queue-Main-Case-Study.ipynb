    "In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services. The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other operations may also be allowed, often including a peek or front operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. \n",

    "    b) Shortest Job First: As the name suggests the processor executes the job which requires the shortest execution time. Even when there are 24 or more processes in the ready queue the processor would pick the 24th process if it was the one that needed less time.\n",

    "    c) Priority based scheduling: Every process comes with an additional data point that comes with priority of the process. The scheduling of the processes will take place according to the received priority. \n",

    "    d) Round robin: In this algorithm, to give every process a chance of execution and reduce the waiting time, every process will be executed for some duration and then will sent into waiting state. Similarly a different process will get chance to execute and this will happen periodically till all the execution is completed. \n",

    "\n",
    "    * Ready Queue: The set of all processes that are in main memory and are waiting for CPU time is kept in the ready queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Waiting (Device) Queues: The set of processes waiting for allocation of certain I/O devices is kept in the waiting (device) queue.\n",
